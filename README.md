# Accounting Ledger

>A CLI program that allows you to add, view, and filter transactions from a CSV file. 
>BufferedReader/Writer were used for reading and writing from the CSV file. Once read from the 
> file the information is stored in an ArrayList of Transaction objects which can then be manipulated and filtered 
> through to provide the user with their desired information.

## What I learned 
> - I had not previously used classes such as BufferedReader/Writer or LocalDateTime classes  so 
> I got the chance to use workbook resources and the Javadoc to look  through all the available methods and fields. 
> - The importance of planning out your program: Once I had finished planning out my program the coding process was 
> somewhat seamless compared to past experiences. I was able to just focus on filling out the classes and methods I had 
> planned on using.
